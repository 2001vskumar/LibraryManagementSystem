📚 Library Management System
A robust Library Management System developed in Java, designed to simplify the management of library operations, including user registration, book management, and order processing. This application showcases the principles of object-oriented programming, data management, and user interface design through a command-line interface.

🚀 Project Overview
The Library Management System allows users to interact with the library's database to perform various operations such as adding and managing books, registering as a user, and placing orders for borrowing books. The system differentiates between admin and normal users, each with their own set of functionalities.

📝 Features
User Registration      : Supports both Admin and Normal User registration, allowing for easy management of library staff and patrons.
Admin Functionalities  :
                         View Books
                         Add and Delete Books
                         Search for Books
                         View Orders
                         Delete all Data
                         Normal User Functionalities:
                         View Books
                         Search for Books
                         Place Orders for Borrowing
                         Calculate Fines
                         Return Books
User Authentication    : Users can log in using their phone number and email for secure access.

🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language   : Java (Core Java)
Libraries              : Standard Java Libraries (java.util, java.io)
Data Handling          : In-memory data management with ArrayLists

🎮 Usage
Upon starting the application, users will be presented with the following options:

Login                  : Enter your phone number and email to access your account.
New User               : Register as a new user (Admin or Normal User) to start using the library system.
Each user type will have different menu options available after logging in, providing relevant functionalities based on their role.

📖 Future Enhancements
Database Integration           : Implement a database (e.g., MySQL) for persistent data storage instead of in-memory management.
Graphical User Interface       : Develop a GUI to enhance user experience and accessibility.
Improved Search Functionality  : Add advanced search filters for better book discovery.
